--fix
        Backup original file and remove JndiLookup.class from JAR recursively.
        With --scan-log4j1 option, it also removes JMSAppender.class, SocketServer.class, SMTPAppender.class, SMTPAppender$1.class

        You can specify multiple --exclude-pattern [pattern] pairs (non regex)
--exclude-fs nfs,tmpfs
        Exclude paths by file system type. nfs, nfs3, nfs4, cifs, tmpfs, devtmpfs, fuse.sshfs and iso9660 is ignored by default.
--syslog-udp [host:port]
        Send alert to remote syslog host for vulnerable or potentially vulnerable binaries
--report-csv
        Generate log4j2_scan_report_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.csv in working directory if not specified otherwise via --report-path [path]
--report-json
        Generate log4j2_scan_report_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.json in working directory if not specified otherwise via --report-path [path]
--report-path
        Specify report output path including filename. Implies --report-csv.
--report-dir
        Specify report output directory. Implies --report-csv.
--no-empty-report
        Do not generate empty report.
--old-exit-code
        Return sum of vulnerable and potentially vulnerable files as exit code.
--debug
        Print exception stacktrace for debugging.
--trace
        Print all directories and files while scanning.
--silent
        Do not print anything until scan is completed.
--help
        Print this help.
```

On Windows
```
log4j2-scan [--fix] target_path
```
On Linux
```
./log4j2-scan [--fix] target_path
```
On UNIX (AIX, Solaris, and so on)
```
java -jar logpresso-log4j2-scan-2.5.0.jar [--fix] target_path
```

If you add `--fix` option, this program will copy vulnerable original JAR file to .bak file, and create new JAR file without `org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class` entry. All .bak files are archived into the single zip file which is named by `log4j2_scan_backup_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.zip`, then deleted safely. In most environments, JNDI lookup feature will not be used. However, you must use this option at your own risk. You can easily restore original vulnerable JAR files using `--restore` option.

Depending the Operating System:

- Windows: It is necessary to shutdown any running JVM process before applying patch due to lock files. Start affected JVM process after fix.
- Linux/macOS: Apply patch, restart the JVM after

If you want to automate patch job, use `--force-fix` option. With this option, this program will no longer prompt for confirmation.

`(mitigated)` tag will be displayed if `org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class` entry is removed from JAR file.

If you add `--trace` option, this program will print all visited directories and files. Use this option only for debugging.

### How it works
Run in 5 steps:
1. Find all .jar, .war, .ear, .aar, .rar, .nar files recursively.
2. Find `META-INF/maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core/pom.properties` entry from JAR file.
3. Read groupId, artifactId, and version.
4. Compare log4j2 version and print vulnerable version.
5. If --fix option is used, backup vulnerable file and patch it.
   * For example, original vulnerable.jar is copied to vulnerable.jar.bak
6. Archive all backup files into the zip file `log4j2_scan_backup_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.zip`, then delete .bak files.   

### Exit code for automation
* -1 failed to run
* 0 for clean (No vulnerability)
* 1 for found
* 2 for some errors
